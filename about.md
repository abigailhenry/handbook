Why a Center for Digital Learning at Geneseo? [Paul Schacht](/authors/schacht), the center's director, tackles that question in his [first blog post](/2020/07/27/why).

Don't have time to read it now? Here's the short version: 

> Without a center to hold them, things don't always fall apart, but they don’t necessarily hang together. 
>
> A range of offices and individuals have long worked hard to advance one or more forms of digital learning at Geneseo — from online courses, to digital pedagogy in the classroom, to research and creative activity at the intersection of digital technology and the liberal arts and sciences. The new Center for Digital Learning will bring increased organization and coordination to this work.&hellip;
>
> We want \[the Center for Digital Learning\] it to be _the_ meeting place for faculty, students, librarians, technology professionals, and others whose interests and expertise converge on a single question: _How can Geneseo best support teaching, learning, scholarship, and creativity that make innovative use of digital tools and methods?_
